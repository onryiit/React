First of all, if you want to running this app you have to do something. The first one is you have install json server on your computer.
If you are using Visual Studio code, you can do easly this. If you dont know how it do this you can find on google easly. After that
when using cmd write there "cd api" and then "json-server --watch db.json" write this. 
other stage is you have to run react. Firstly you should install node js on your computer after that you can start my project on your editor
and write "cd firstapp" and then write "npm start". Thats it!!! You run my project.
